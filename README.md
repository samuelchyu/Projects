Visual Data Analysis (VDA)

Overview

The Visual Data Analysis (VDA) project is designed to provide insightful visual representations of complex datasets, 
enabling better decision-making through intuitive charts, graphs, and dashboards. This project applies advanced data 
visualization techniques to uncover trends, anomalies, and correlations within datasets.

Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning for optimal visualization
Custom visualizations tailored for different business needs
Implementation of machine learning-driven insights into visual representations

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Jupyter Notebook
Streamlit (for interactive visualization deployment)
(Streamlit sections are not found here, while it works on my personal computer, a deeper knowledge-base is needed to implement as a full website)

Future Improvements
Integration with real-time data sources
Advanced AI-driven analytics and automated insights
More dynamic and customizable visual components

Banking Campaign Analysis:

Overview:

The Banking Campaign project analyzes the effectiveness of marketing campaigns in the banking sector. 
The objective is to evaluate customer responses to various campaign strategies and optimize targeting for future campaigns.

Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Predictive modeling to determine customer response likelihood
Performance evaluation of marketing campaign models

Technologies Used

R (ggplot, tidyverse, rpart, c5.0, naivebayes, random forests)
Machine Learning (Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forest)
Markdown/LateX

Future Improvements
Implement deep learning techniques for customer segmentation
Incorporate external economic and behavioral data
Develop an interactive web-based campaign performance dashboard
